# Online Banking Simulator developed using Spring Boot.

There are two roles : user and admin

- USER :
	He has a normal user rights and can create account, deposit or withdraw money.
	He can only be able to access his own accounts and profile
- ADMIN :
	As admin you have functionality to see all the customers, access all accounts, 
	view/edit/delete user transactions . But you can't see users' passwords because they are encoded
	with BCrypt algorithm
